In C++, an interface is a class that only contains pure virtual functions (abstract methods) and no data members or concrete implementations. It serves as a contract or a blueprint for classes that inherit from it, specifying the methods that these derived classes must implement. An interface defines what a class should do without defining how it should do it.

                C++ doesn't have a dedicated keyword like other programming languages (e.g., Java or C#) to declare an interface. Instead, an interface is typically achieved using an abstract class with pure virtual functions.

                Here's a simple example of an interface in C++:

                ```cpp
#include <iostream>

// The interface (abstract class)
                class Shape {
                public:
                    // Pure virtual function (abstract method)
                    virtual void draw() const = 0;

                        // Virtual destructor (important when working with polymorphism)
                        virtual ~Shape() {}
                    };

// Concrete class implementing the Shape interface
class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() const override {
        std::cout << "Drawing a circle." << std::endl;
    }
};

// Concrete class implementing the Shape interface
class Square : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() const override {
        std::cout << "Drawing a square." << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Creating objects of concrete classes
    Circle circle;
    Square square;

    // Using the Shape interface to draw different shapes
    Shape* shape1 = &circle;
    Shape* shape2 = &square;

    shape1->draw(); // Output: Drawing a circle.
    shape2->draw(); // Output: Drawing a square.

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define an interface `Shape` with a pure virtual function `draw()`. The `Circle` and `Square` classes inherit from the `Shape` interface and implement the `draw()` method according to their specific shapes. In the `main()` function, we demonstrate polymorphism by using pointers of the `Shape` interface to draw different shapes without knowing the specific implementations. This shows how we can achieve an interface - like behavior in C++.
